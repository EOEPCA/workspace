            Workspace is a namespaced composite representing a collaborative working area.
            A primary object storage bucket with the same name as the workspace is created
            automatically. Additional buckets can be requested via `spec.extraBuckets`.
            Access to buckets owned by other workspaces can be requested via `spec.linkedBuckets`,
            and this workspace can grant access to others using `spec.grants`.
